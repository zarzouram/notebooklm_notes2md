> [!summary]
> This source delves into the **mechanics of simulating a fair market**, emphasizing how prices are determined within such an environment. It outlines a **daily cycle** where randomly acting buyers and sellers place orders based on **distinct probability distributions centered around the previous day's price**. The core of price determination lies in **Auction Pricing**, a mechanism designed to find the **"middle ground" of order overlap** to maximize "total satisfaction" and set the day's single market price and trading volume. Ultimately, this simulated fair market is characterized by **random movement and unpredictability**, with prices exhibiting a **natural pull back to a "gravitational center"** due to wealth limitations, and **increased volume leading to less price volatility**.

# Simulating a Fair Market: Mechanics and Price Behavior

## Market Simulation Overview

This note explains how market prices are determined through a daily simulation cycle.

- Buyers and sellers act independently based on probability distributions
- Price discovery happens through an auction mechanism
- Volume and price movement show interesting statistical properties

## Auction Pricing Mechanism

The auction pricing mechanism is the core of the simulation:

1. All buy and sell orders are collected
2. Orders are arranged by price (descending for buys, ascending for sells)
3. The price that maximizes the "overlap" of buy and sell orders is chosen
4. This price becomes the single market price for all transactions that day

## Price Behavior Characteristics

The resulting price behavior shows several important characteristics:

- Random movement due to probabilistic buyer/seller actions
- Mean reversion to a "gravitational center" due to wealth constraints
- Lower volatility with higher trading volumes
- No persistent trends without external influences
